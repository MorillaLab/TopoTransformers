    "Based on the provided information, the best result for learning on dataset Y1 risk of mortality was achieved using the training algorithm with constant learning rate and momentum, with a perfect training set score of 1.000 and a training set loss of 0.002. The algorithms with Nesterov's momentum also produced similar results, with a training set score of 1.000 and a training set loss of 0.002 for constant learning rate and 0.186 for inv-scaling learning rate. Patient_XXX optimizer also produced a perfect training set score of 1.000 and a training set loss of 0.002. However, the inv-scaling learning rate algorithm without momentum had a lower training set score of 0.826 and a higher training set loss of 0.410."
