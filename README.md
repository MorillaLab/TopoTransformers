Early Identification of High-Risk Individuals for Mortality after Lung Transplantation: A Retrospective Cohort Study with Topological Transformers

Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage respiratory diseases, but it is associated with a high risk of mortality and complications. In this study, we conducted a dynamic analysis of lung transplantation trajectories using clinical variables such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use, acute renal failure, and history of rejection. Our algorithm identified distinct patterns of behavior in survivor and non-survivor individuals, with younger survivors exhibiting a simpler and more recovery-driven course of ECMO therapy. Additionally, we identified non-linear relationships between clinical variables, highlighting the importance of advanced statistical methods and machine learning in developing predictive models in healthcare.
Furthermore, we proposed a model for mortality risk prediction after Y1 of lung transplantation based on topological transformers, which improve the performance of any existing predictive model. Our model takes into account clinical variables as well as the dynamic changes in these variables over time, providing a more accurate prediction of mortality risk. We evaluated the performance of our model using a retrospective cohort of lung transplant patients and compared it to other existing predictive models. Our results showed that our model outperformed those other models, including the Lung Transplant Risk Index (LTRI), in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
In conclusion, our proposed model can help clinicians early identify patients at high risk of mortality after Y1 of lung transplantation and provide timely interventions to improve outcomes.
